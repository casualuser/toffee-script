ToffeeScript 

ToffeeScript base on IcedCoffeeScript from 1.5.0

	Before 1.5.0, The code ToffeeScript generated is simple but clean, it's exactly equals native javascript. but it's not powerful, the loop and condition supporting is missed, and IcedCoffeeScript gives very useful features, so from 1.5.0 I decided to base on IcedCoffeeScript, though there the performance will decrease slightly and will generate more addition code.

Additional Fetaures of ToffeeScript

	Assigments = FunctionName! Arguments

	to

	await FunctionName Arguments, defer(Assignments)


	eg:

2.  autocb supports multiple return

	when using multiple return, the keyword return cannot be omitted.

	foo = (autocb) ->
		return null, 3

	e, v = foo!
	console.log e, v # output 'null 3'
