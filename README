ToffeeScript 

ToffeeScript base on IcedCoffeeScript from 1.5.0

	Before 1.5.0, The code ToffeeScript generated is simple and clean, it's exactly equals native javascript. but the loop and condition supporting is missed, so from 1.5.0 I decided to base on IcedCoffeeScript, though there the performance will decrease slightly and more addition generated code.

1. basic async

	! async grammar

	Assigments = FunctionName! Arguments

	to

	await FunctionName defer(Arguments)


	eg:

		x, y = fn! a, b, c

		to

		await fn a, b, c, defer(x, y)

2.  autocb supports multiple return

	when using multiple return, the keyword return cannot be omitted.

	foo = (autocb) ->
		return null, 3

	e, v = foo!
	console.log e, v # output 'null 3'
